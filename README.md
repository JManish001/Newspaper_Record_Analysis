This is a java project to solve the problem of gathering and maintaining data in a Newspaper Agency. What happens is that in a Newspaper Agency the data of customers and Hawkers is maintained manually. The data of papers is managed with the paper name along with their prices of that particular print. Then the data of Hawkers is stored as name, address, Aadhar card number, contact, and the areas which are assigned. The data of Customers are stored as name, address, mobile no. and an area along with the particular hawker assigned. The papers which are selected by customers appear along with their corresponding prices. The Owner can generate the bill from the day the customer joined his agency till any preferred date. A certain feature is added that shows the billing amount is paid or not. If it is paid then the status is automatically generated 1 else 0. The data of hawkers, customers, and billing vouchers appear in a tabular form. All the data is stored in the Database. An additional attribute of converting data to an excel sheet is attached. These all aspects are covered through a built-in Desktop Assistant for Such Agencies.
